## Code

The code provided is written in Python 3.6, and relies on the following libraries:
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)

Some usage examples (the same ones used in the experimental section of the paper) can be found in the
[examples/](odin/examples/) directory. Comments in the code illustrate how it can be further applied to
generic ODE models not included here.
